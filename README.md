schorm

A CLI-driven static-site generator for SCORM 2004 e-learning content.

⸻

## Overview

schorm is a command-line tool for building SCORM 2004 packages using a workflow inspired by modern static site generators (e.g., Hugo, MkDocs, Eleventy).

Instead of using a heavy CMS or visual authoring tool, schorm lets you create SCORM-compliant courses using:
	•	Markdown for lessons
	•	YAML/JSON for quizzes and metadata
	•	Handlebars templates for HTML layouts
	•	A lightweight runtime JS layer for SCORM API integration
	•	A clean CLI for init → build → preview → package

This makes SCORM content:
	•	version-controllable
	•	LLM-friendly
	•	developer-friendly
	•	reproducible
	•	scriptable
	•	transparent

schorm is a great fit for teams who want to automate course creation, integrate AI agents, or simply avoid the bloat of multi-user CMS systems like Adapt Authoring.

## Project Status

**Early development (v0.1)**
This is the foundational repository setup. Core architecture, CLI scaffolding, and default theme structure are being implemented.
Not suitable for production use yet.

## Features (Current & Planned)

MVP Goals
	•	🔧 `schorm init` — create a new SCORM project with default structure
	•	🧱 `schorm new` — scaffold modules, lessons, and quizzes
	•	🏗️ `schorm build` — render content → HTML + templates → SCORM-ready structure
	•	🌐 `schorm preview` — local server with mock SCORM runtime
	•	📦 `schorm package` — create SCORM 2004 ZIP for upload to an LMS
	•	🔍 `schorm validate` — manifest + structure checks

Core Principles
	•	CLI-first, file-first
	•	Static-site generator mental model
	•	LLM-friendly schemas
	•	Minimal viable SCORM 2004 subset
	•	Deterministic builds

Planned Later
	•	Linting rules (schorm lint)
	•	JSON schemas (schorm schema)
	•	Course graph export (schorm graph)
	•	Additional sequencing rules
	•	Multi-SCO themes
	•	Theming system with multiple built-in themes

Quick Start (once implemented)

# Install globally
`npm install -g schorm`

# Create a new course project
`schorm init northhaven-onboarding`
`cd northhaven-onboarding`

# Add content
`schorm new module m1 "Introduction"`
`schorm new lesson m1/intro "The Owner–Operator Relationship"`
`schorm new quiz m1/quiz "Intro Quiz"`

# Build and preview locally
`schorm build`
`schorm preview --open`

# Validate & package as a SCORM 2004 ZIP
schorm validate
schorm package

Project Structure

A typical schorm project looks like:

course.yml             # course structure & metadata
schorm.config.yml      # global build configuration
content/               # Markdown lessons
quizzes/               # YAML quiz specifications
media/                 # images, audio, video
theme/                 # Handlebars templates + assets
build/                 # generated output (not committed)

The output of schorm build includes:
	•	HTML lessons/quizzes
	•	media files
	•	SCORM runtime JS
	•	generated imsmanifest.xml
	•	assets from the theme

All of this is zipped by schorm package into a SCORM-compliant bundle.

Why schorm?

1. A modern workflow for SCORM

Most SCORM tools assume non-technical authors and rely on heavyweight GUIs, databases, or server-side CMSes.

schorm takes a different approach:
	•	treat SCORM content as a static site
	•	represent everything as files (Markdown, YAML, CSS)
	•	keep authors close to their content
	•	keep LMS-specific logic inside a small runtime library

2. Great for automation and AI workflows

Since schorm is file-driven and uses strict JSON/YAML schemas, it is ideal for:
	•	LLM content generation
	•	structured course creation agents
	•	CI pipelines that auto-build and validate SCORM packages
	•	GitOps workflows

3. Transparent, maintainable, durable

Your course is just a folder of files.
Everything is inspectable.
Everything works offline.
Everything is version-controllable.
