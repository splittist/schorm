## Ignored the Problem

Your phone shows:

**15 missed calls from "Boss"**

### Analysis

Ignoring a crisis never makes it go away; it only lets others control the narrative.

By going silent, you forced your CEO to clean up your mess without any context. They had to apologize to MegaCorp without knowing your side of the story, making the company look even worse.

You are definitely getting written up on Monday. Your career at this company may not survive this.

**Key Lesson:** Silence in a crisis is the worst possible response. Own your mistakes immediately.
