## Fired

A security guard escorts you to your desk. There's a cardboard box waiting for you.

### Analysis

Making a mistake is human. Lying about it—especially when it involves wasting IT security resources on a wild goose chase—is a fireable offense involving integrity.

You didn't just lose the client; you lost your job. The company can't trust someone who doubles down on deception when caught in an error.

Your reputation in the industry will suffer. References from this company will be... challenging.

**Key Lesson:** The cover-up is always worse than the crime. Integrity under pressure is what separates professionals from amateurs.
