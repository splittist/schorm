## Survived, Barely

A calendar invite appears for 9:00 AM Monday:

**"Incident Review"** with HR and your Manager.

### Analysis

You survived, but just barely. By either trying to hide first or by over-apologizing and making it emotional, you looked unprofessional.

The damage is contained, but your CEO trusts your judgment a lot less today than they did yesterday. You'll be under closer scrutiny for the next few months.

**Key Lesson:** Crisis management requires both owning mistakes AND maintaining composure. Panic undermines credibility.
