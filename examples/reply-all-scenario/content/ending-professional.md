## Good Recovery

An email reply from your CEO arrives:

> "Good recovery. Let's discuss Monday."

### Analysis

You made a huge mistake, but your response showed maturity. By owning it instantly and pivoting back to solving the client's problem, you minimized the damage.

The client is still annoyed, but they respect that you didn't try to hide or make excuses. You handled a crisis with professionalism.

**Key Lesson:** When you make a catastrophic error, speed and sincerity in owning the mistake are far more effective than panicked technical fixes or deception.
