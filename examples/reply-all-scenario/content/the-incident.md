It's Friday at 3:45 PM. An angry client, "MegaCorp," just emailed your CEO complaining about a delayed shipment. Your CEO forwards it to you asking for context.

Exhausted, you type a venting draft reply to just your CEO:

> "Ugh, MegaCorp is being ridiculous again. They caused the delay themselves by changing the order on Tuesday. I'll smooth it over, but seriously, they are the worst."

Your finger slips. Instead of "Reply," you hit **"Reply All."**

The email—snark included—has just been sent to your CEO **and** the angry client at MegaCorp.
